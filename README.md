# s80tools

Howdy y'all,

In the long run, I hope that S80Tools becomes a nifty replacement
application for the Doogee S80, much like MD380Tools became a
replacement firmware for the Tytera MD380 radio.

But there's a lot of work to be done first, and we'll be tracking that
work on the (wiki)[https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/s80tools/wiki].

```
git clone https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/s80tools
git clone https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/s80tools.wiki
```

Cheers from Knoxville,
